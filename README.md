# Softerware_Ticketing_System-
AI Model for Ticket Resolution (Web App)This project implements an AI model to classify support tickets into L1, L2, and L3 categories and provide a suggested solution or an escalation report, accessible via a web interface.Project Structureindex.html: The frontend web page for interacting with the model.ticket_classifier.py: The Python backend server (using Flask) that hosts the AI model.requirements.txt: A list of Python packages required to run the project.sample_tickets.csv: Sample data used for training the model.README.md: This file.How It WorksThe application consists of a simple frontend and a Python backend.Backend (Flask Server): When you run ticket_classifier.py, it first loads the data from sample_tickets.csv, trains a machine learning model, and then starts a web server. This server waits for requests from the frontend.Frontend (Web Page): When you open index.html in your browser, you see an interface to type in a ticket. When you submit a query, the page sends that text to the backend server.Prediction: The backend receives the query, uses the trained model to classify it as L1, L2, or L3, and sends the result back to the frontend.Display: The frontend displays the classification and suggested solution in the browser.Setup and InstallationClone the repository:git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run the Web AppRunning the application is a two-step process:Step 1: Start the Backend ServerFirst, open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command. This will train the model and start the server.python ticket_classifier.py
You should see output indicating the server is running, something like * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Keep this terminal window open.Step 2: Open the Web InterfaceNow, find the index.html file in your project folder and open it with your web browser (you can usually just double-click it).You can now type a ticket into the text box and click "Classify Ticket" to get a real-time classification from your AI model.
